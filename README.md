# genesis
A Collection of Projects for my Motorola 68000 Embedded System.  
This repository is to highlight my technical knowhow and experimentation working with EPPROMS and Computer Architecture.
This is one of many Embedded Systems projects I intend on creating to further hone in on my infactuation for Computer Architecture.

``Inspiration``

This project was heavily inspired by YouTuber, Ben Eater, and his endless array of videos going over Embedded Systems.
As well as working on a MOS 6502-based Computer which really opened up my eyes to a lot of endeavours I could pursue in the hopes of finding my niche.
