# genesis
A Collection of Projects for my Motorola 68000 Embedded System.  

Think of this as my way of experimenting with the Motorola 68000 as well as making my own CISC-based CPU

This repository is to highlight my technical knowhow and experimentation working with EPPROMS and Computer Architecture.
This is one of many Embedded Systems projects I intend on creating to further hone in on my infactuation for Computer Architecture.

``Inspiration``

This project was heavily inspired by YouTuber, Ben Eater, and his endless array of videos going over Embedded Systems.
As well as working on a MOS 6502-based Computer which really opened up my eyes to a lot of endeavours I could pursue in the hopes of finding my niche.
